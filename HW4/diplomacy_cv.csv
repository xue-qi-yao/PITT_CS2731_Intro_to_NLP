Well, I generally don’t like to play as Italy at all, frankly. But when I do, I go east. Not sure whether I’ll head towards Turkey or Austria, but I think the one big advantage that you and I both have is that we have a mutual border that is easy to keep clear. 

I’m not moving west. It takes forever to get there, and there are rarely centers there for me when I arrive. I hope you feel the same way about moving towards me. 

I’d like to keep our border clear and I’d like to act as “trio wires” for each other. Basically, if either Germany or England want to attack you, I expect they’ll mention something to me, and if you’ll look out for me diplomatically, I’ll give you a head’s up if ever you need to worry.

I am outnumbered and I obviously can’t solo. And I’m sure some of you in the north are eager to send everyone else flying my way, but I expect Russia and England to be careful, and so I’m not sure there is much room to move forward without simply tipping the board to Germany’s favor.

This will fool them sufficiently that the Germans can use the army in Kiel to support the fleet in Belgium into the Netherlands as well as the fleet in the Bight, ceding Belgium to you in the process, while also freeing me of one necessary support so that I can move from Sweden to Skagerrak, and the British lose two of their units this build phase.

This is definitely a unique game given the time constraints and high stakes. I intend to strike Northwest in an attempt to build a large fleet line extending across the North Atlantic.

I take RUM, but agree to take no centers South of RUM.
Spring 1901 I move A MOS-STP
We both agree to a total DMZ in GAL
Fall 1901 I will move A WAR North
I will use any available strength along my Southern border to support you in taking the Balkans and Turkey throughout the game.

They have basically communicated with nobody, haven't really attacked anyone, and had a good amount of invalid orders.

Meanwhile, turkey has gotten 12 centers, and is in a great position—you territory is exposed, and turkey is likely going to break through my defenses as well. It's more than likely that turkey is going for the solo. Just saying—if turkey wins, it's because all of u guys were selfish and ignored the bigger threat at hand.

I am outnumbered and I obviously can’t solo. And I’m sure some of you in the north are eager to send everyone else flying my way, but I expect Russia and England to be careful, and so I’m not sure there is much room to move forward without simply tipping the board to Germany’s favor.

Everybody vastly overreacted, worrying that I was going to go for the solo, since I had 11 centers. Even though I clearly wasn't going to, literally EVERYONE teamed up against me, reducing me to 9.

Meanwhile, turkey has gotten 12 centers, and is in a great position—Russia is exposed, and they are likely going to break through my defenses as well.

At this stage, my excitement about the game has diminished quite a bit. And of course I’m happy to play on and take my lumps for falling for “Hey, I really want you to solo, just help me place second,” but if you guys just want to call it a five-way draw among us and grab a beer together, while reviewing the statistics, that’s really my preference. 

I am outnumbered and I obviously can’t solo. And I’m sure some of you in the north are eager to send everyone else flying my way, but I expect Russia and England to be careful, and so I’m not sure there is much room to move forward without simply tipping the board to Germany’s favor. 

I propose that we draw and hug it out.🤗",italy-Game1,Game1-italy-russia-84,Game1-italy-russia,russia-Game1,2512,85,1908,13,8,1
